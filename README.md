# Scheduler-Application

This is a responsive, mobile-friendly day planner web application that allows the user to save hourly notes onto an agenda, and store notes into local storage. The agenda includes note fields for 9AM through 5PM. It renders the past, current, and future tasks by color, and updates itself in realtime. The application also displays the current date at the top of the screen.
